### LuxDevHQ Data Engineering Project

During Weeks 14 and 15 of the LuxDevHQ Bootcamp, participants work on individual projects before the finalists proceed to their final capstone project. These projects are designed to reflect real-world applications. Each cohort is assigned its own set of projects, although in some cases, finalists may repeat previous ones or tackle entirely new challenges.


### Why Do We Encourage Dedicating These Weeks to Projects?

#### 1.  Hands-On Exposure to Real-World Challenges
These projects simulate actual industry problems, allowing learners to apply what they’ve learned in a meaningful way.

They help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.

---

#### 2. Iterative Learning Before the Capstone
Learners get to experiment, fail safely, and refine their skills before the high-stakes final project.

This improves problem-solving, collaboration, and technical decision-making under semi-real conditions.

---

#### 3. Portfolio & Confidence Booster
Completing real-world projects adds serious value to a learner’s portfolio and boosts their confidence.

It also prepares them to talk about practical experience in interviews — something many bootcamps struggle to offer at this depth.
